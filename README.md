# Team 4: Picture Puzzle #
We are building a puzzle in the Ubiquitous Computing Lab (UCL) aka Escape Room in WS21/22.
The Firmware folder contains all the Software code used for this project. 
In the Sequences folder are the created sequences as .mp4 and .pdf and also a solution file.
The Hardware folder contains most of the manuals and guides for the used hardware parts in our riddle for example the pin-assignment for the ESP32.
